### About Me

Hi there, I'm Diego ðŸ‘‹

I am a software engineer with a passion for solving hard problems and a business value-add mindset. Previously, I built spreadsheets and analyzed bond investments at Travelers. I studied Applied Computational Math & Economics at Notre Dame.

I was born in Dallas but have lived in over 10 different cities between 3 countries and speak Spanish and Portuguese. When not coding, you can catch me playing tennis, reading, or enjoying music. I love to learn and some of my favorite topics to read and write about are: probability/ game theory, the economics of the tech industry, and mindfulness.
